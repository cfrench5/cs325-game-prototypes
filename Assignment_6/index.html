<h2>Battle Die!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Perhaps what I believe is original about this game is that players after having collected 4 of the green pickup, they need to get back to home base. However, since the rules of 
this game dictate that they MUST move X amount of spaces, it's a game of chance whoever can make it back to their base first.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game utilizes the mouse to click the "Roll Dice" button, as well as click where a player wants their player character to move X squares.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Well, since I have'nt done the past 3 digital assignments, it was hard to get my bearings on this one. I encoutered a lot of stupid errors with my specific computer and Google 
Chrome, where I found the games I made work better in Microsoft Edge, but I don't know why. Anyways, it was a bit hard to implement the clicking system since once again this is
is my first time doing it, as well as creating the board itself, which became easier to understand, both parts honestly, after some advice from a fellow classmate.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Previous game of the same name, the physical one named Battle Die!, though much has been changed. I learned that my physical prototype had some broken mechanics, and since I 
wasn't sure (at least at the moment) how I'd implement the Battle system I had, I decided to change it into a collect the items the fastest and return kind of thing. There's
still a competitve aspect and random movement to the die, which is definitely what I wanted to keep so I don't think it turned out that bad, but still, I'd like to implement
a battle system later if possible.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Simple and fun boardgame where you're out to collect the green pickups first, and head back to base first.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This was an iteration of the game we did last week.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: A lot of randomness
Play Style: Competitor
Genre: Boardgame
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For the moment, I really wanted to try out the "player MUST move X spaces" according to their die roll, as well as the players picking up the collectibles (which in this case is
just a green pickup, originally I wanted it have stat pickups like ATK and DEF), and return to base. Honestly, I wasn't sure how I'd implement the player being able to choose 
their direction, but I did after some pain and suffering, though I think it's still a bit buggy on that end.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is supposed to be for some leisurely fun, for two people who just want to add a tally to their win streak against their friends or family. Though this game is 
luck-based, so those not confident in their luck beware!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This is a turn-based, dice roll movement game, where Player 1 will go first, use the mouse to click the 'Roll Dice' button, and click the direction they wish to move that many 
spaces, where Player 2 will then do the same. Each player must collect 4 or more of the green pickups spread throughout the map. Once a player has collected 4 or more, they must
head back to their respective home base in order to win the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The strategies involve spacing yourself appropriately after one has gotten at least 4 of the green item. I say this because after much testing, that despite being random, 
the way the game works you must move a certain distance. Other than that no real strategy otherwise.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
No real story here, just two player characters collecting 4 or more of the green power-up and head back to base.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For younger kids and teen mainly, where this game is meant as another time passer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Around 3 to 5 minutes.
</li>
