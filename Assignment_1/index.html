<h2>Paddle Practice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    It's a game to hone those brickbreaker pong skills!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    Can't say anything worthy of interest.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    How to use HTML a little bit, as well as code in JavaScript.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    Actually learning HTML, and trying my best to get it to actually work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    I did not make assets from scratch, instead I borrowed them. On the site below, I borrowed the assets from the Breakout 
    game after downloading the zip file below the provided code.
<ul>
<li>Breakout Code: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/breakout">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    The closest other game would be the game I borrowed, which is Breakout. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game to test how long can last and how high one can score playing pong by oneself with only one life.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    None.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    The input is meant to be for a mouse, and the genre arcade/casual. There is also no real randomness, and the playstyle is simple and reflex based.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    Only game mechanic is trying to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen by touching it with the paddle.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    A fun way to kill time, and increase your hand-eye coordination.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    The player can move the paddle around with their mouse in order to hit the ball. Asides from that there are no other controls besides hitting enter to try again. The ball has physics based off that of the phaser engine, and the main goal is to last as long as one can before the ball hits the bottom of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    Being fast and nimble with a mouse/touchpad.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    There is no story for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    People bored on the internet looking for a game to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    As long as you are able to keep the ball on the field (the screen).
