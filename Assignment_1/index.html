<h2>Paddle Practice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    It's a game to hone those brickbreaker pong skills!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    Can't say anything worthy of interest.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    How to use HTML a little bit, as well as code in JavaScript.
    Actually learning HTML, and trying my best to get it to actually work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    I did not make assets from scratch, instead I borrowed them. On the site below, I borrowed the assets from the Breakout 
    game after downloading the zip file below the provided code.
<ul>
<li>Breakout Code: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/breakout">Breakout Code</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    The closest other game would be the game I borrowed, which is Breakout. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game to test how long can last and how high one can score playing pong by oneself with only one life.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    None.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    The input is meant to be for a mouse, and the genre arcade/casual. There is also no real randomness, and the playstyle is simple and reflex based.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    Only game mechanic is trying to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen by touching it with the paddle.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    A fun way to kill time, and increase your hand-eye coordination.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The player can move the paddle around with their mouse in order to hit the ball. Asides from that there are no other controls besides hitting enter to try again. The ball has physics based off that of the phaser engine, and the main goal is to last as long as one can before the ball hits the bottom of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    Being fast and nimble with a mouse/touchpad.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    There is no story for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    People bored on the internet looking for a game to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    As long as you are able to keep the ball on the field (the screen).
</li>
