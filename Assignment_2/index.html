<h2>Egg Scramble!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Though this kind of game has been done before where you go from stage to stage to collect an item, I hope to make power-ups that would either boost the players speed or jumps, or something like that and add a constant enemy that chases the player through the level at some point. Though I'm not sure how hard that would be.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
 To be honest, I'm still not sure how to answer this question still.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I finally learned how to add sound and backgrounds to the game, and well, actually getting it to work. In fact the adding of the background and sound was the easiest part. Perhaps the "hardest" was editing and creating some sprites for this game, since it took some time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the bar that's visible in the game, and I also edited the farmer sprite, but the farmer sprite wasn't mine. The list of everything I borrowed is below.
<ul>
<li>Player sprite: <a href="http://michaelcummings.net/mathoms/creating-2d-animated-sprites-using-unity-4.3">Player sprite</a></li>
<li>Egg sprite: <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lucky_Egg">Egg sprite</a></li>
<li>Farm Background: <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lucky_Egg">Farm Background</a></li>
<li>Hen Chicken Sound: <a href="http://soundbible.com/1022-Hen-Chicken.html">Hen Chicken sound</a></li>
<li>Borrowed Phaser Code: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/platformer-tight">Borrowed Phaser Code</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest resembling game to mine would be Starstruck, though the code I borrowed was actually from the phaser examples named "Platformer Tight".
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A "challenging" platformer where the farmer must go around and collect the eggs in each level, each level being harder than the last.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the Chicken storymatic theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input here is directed, and there is no randomness intended to be in this platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Right now, it's just a simple platformer where I hope to add power-ups of sorts, more levels, and an enemy(ies) later.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Like any game is meant to be, I want players to have fun with it, and hopefully part of that would be the fun in the challenge I hope to present.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay is rather simple, as you use the directional arrow keys to move left or right, and space to jump. You also press the ENTER key to play agian when the game has ended. The goal is to collect the egg on a certain platform, and the difficulty in obtaining it is supposed to rise level to level.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being adept and quick with the jumping in this game. Once a person has mastery over how the jumping works the game will become easier to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
I haven't planned to much for the story of this game, except for something along the lines of a farmer's chicken is laying eggs all around his barn so he has to scramble to collect them before a wolf catches them (wolf not implemented yet).
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Intended to be for people who like challenging platformers (even if at the moment it isn't exactly challenging).
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The playtime would vary from person to person, but no more than at least 5 minutes, at least until other levels are added later.
</li>
