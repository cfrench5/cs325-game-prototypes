<h2>Battle Die!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Perhaps what I believe is original about this game is that players after having collected 4 of the green pickup, they need to get back to home base. However, since the rules of 
this game dictate that they MUST move X amount of spaces, it's a game of chance whoever can make it back to their base first.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game utilizes the mouse to click the "Roll Dice" button, as well as click where a player wants their player character to move X squares.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Honestly, I don't know why, but I couldn't figure out my problem with implementing the battle system I had intended for this game. That being where when a
player gets a score of 4 or more, and they walk over another player, the player that's being attacked has a chance to defend. For whatever reason, it
wouldn't work after the if statement I had put it after, and in the end I couldn't figure it out. So the only thing I ended up changing for this game was
if a player with a score of 4 or more, comes into contact with another player, that player wins. I also added some background music, but other than that not 
much else.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Previous game of the same name, the digital one named Battle Die!, though not much has been changed honestly besides an alternate win condition and some
music.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Simple and fun boardgame where you're out to collect the green pickups first, and head back to base first.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This was an iteration of the game we did last week.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: A lot of randomness
Play Style: Competitor
Genre: Boardgame
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For the moment, I really wanted to try out the "player MUST move X spaces" according to their die roll, as well as the players picking up the collectibles (which in this case is
just a green pickup, originally I wanted it have stat pickups like ATK and DEF), and return to base. Honestly, I wasn't sure how I'd implement the player being able to choose 
their direction, but I did after some pain and suffering, though I think it's still a bit buggy on that end.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is supposed to be for some leisurely fun, for two people who just want to add a tally to their win streak against their friends or family. Though this game is 
luck-based, so those not confident in their luck beware!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This is a turn-based, dice roll movement game, where Player 1 will go first, use the mouse to click the 'Roll Dice' button, and click the direction they wish to move that many 
spaces, where Player 2 will then do the same. Each player must collect 4 or more of the green pickups spread throughout the map. Once a player has collected 4 or more, they must
head back to their respective home base in order to win the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The strategies involve spacing yourself appropriately after one has gotten at least 4 of the green item. I say this because after much testing, that despite being random, 
the way the game works you must move a certain distance. Other than that no real strategy otherwise.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
No real story here, just two player characters collecting 4 or more of the green power-up and head back to base.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For younger kids and teen mainly, where this game is meant as another time passer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Around 3 to 5 minutes.
</li>
