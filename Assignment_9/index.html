<h2>Evasion Robot</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of this game comes from the avoidance aspect of the player dodging the bullet on a small grid. Also, to mitigate certain RNG, so to allow for
the player to have an easier time, the shield power up was implemented, which protects the player and destroys any bullets they come in contact with for a 
brief period of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Perhaps what could count as technicla merit here is the masking of sprites (the bullets only appearing on the center grid rather than the border), and that 
of the power up (the shield).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I honestly didn't really know what else to add to this game besides some things people suggested. Thus the only things I added was a timer to keep track of 
how long a player survived, the ability to restart by pressing enter, and the shrinking of the hitbox and adding a shield sound effect. Was annoying somewhat
when initially trying to implement them as the game wouldn't work quite a few times when trying to do so, so I had to trace back and find the problem, but
eventually I solved it.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Previous game Robot Rampage, the digital one named Robot Evasion, though a lot has changed from the physical to digital.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move around the base avoiding the incoming bullets coming towards the robot, using your shield to protect and destroy them in a battle to see how long you 
can last!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This was an iteration of the game we did last week, so in this case soldier.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse moves the player around, instead of clicking and selecting where to go.
Randomness: Randomness on the bullets flying at the player, but not on the player itself.
Play Style: Competitor
Genre: Avoidance (I'm not sure what to label this games' genre as at the moment).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For now, I wanted to test the idea of the grid, as well as the player (robot) movement with the mouse. I was thinking about trying out the idea of health,
since it is very prevalent in my physical prototype, but I will try adding that in the next iteration. So for now, the goal is to pretend the bullets are 
coming from sort of military weapon, and the robot (at the moment, perhaps even permanently) must dodge sence they are defenseless, only having the shield
to protect themselves. Though the idea of this game being "any period of time" exists instead of a given one like the physical, due to how different in 
nature this is to the physical.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game should be a fun yet challenging experience for players, especially for those who wish to test their reflex skills, though be warned that this is a
"pixel perfect" kind of game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will move their character with the mouse, dodging the red bullets that come from all sides, which if they happen to come into contact with their 
robot will explode. To mitigate this, the player has a shield that can block and destroy bullets for a period of time, but they must wait awhile before they
can use it again. The player's goal is to survive for as long as possible (for the time being).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
After a lot of testing, the best strategy turns out to stay in the center of the map, only using the shield when trapped into a corner, or too many appear in
the center of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
No real story here, just a player character that happens to be a robot, where they player must try and survive for as long as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For younger kids and teens mainly, where this game is meant as another time passer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The playtime is technically infinite, since a player doesn't lose until they finally come in contact with a red bullet (without their shield up).
